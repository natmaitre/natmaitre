- 👋 Hi, I’m @natmaitre
- 👀 I’m interested in coding since I got my first computer. I did explore lots of various things and I will continue to !
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, css and javascripts. Also did some arduino, unreal engine and before that unity. (but just a little 😁)
- 💞️ I just do little project for fun ! Sometime alone or with my dad.
